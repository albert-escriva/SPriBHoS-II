# SPriBHoS-II 

Python code based on spectral methods to simulate the gravitational collapse of spherically symmetric super-horizon fluctuations, leading to the formation of Primordial Black Holes. 
The code basically follows the same methodology as SPriBHoS code (ArXiv:1907.13065), but introduces a new approach using the Misner-Sharp formalism, which allows the simulation of generic curvature fluctuations (in particular type-II).

This code was developed and used in the work: A. Escriv√†, ArXiv:2504.05813. Check the paper for details.

The current release corresponds to version v1.0.0, with basic and simple functionalities. Future updates will be posted soon.
