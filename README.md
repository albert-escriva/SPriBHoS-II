# SPriBHoS-II 

Python code based on spectral methods to simulate the gravitational collapse of spherically symmetric super-horizon fluctuations, leading to the formation of Primordial Black Holes. 
The code basically follows the same methodology as SPriBHoS code, but introduces a new approach using the Misner-Sharp formalism, which allows the simulation of generic curvature fluctuations (in particular type-II).

This code was developed and used in the work: A. Escriv√†, ArXiv:XXXXXXX. Check the paper for details.
If the code was useful to you, please consider citing the paper and this repository

The current version corresponds to a pre-release v0.9.0-beta, which includes the basic method with a simple working example for illustrative purposes. 

The official version v1.0.0 with more functionalities will be released soon.
